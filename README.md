# Bing COVID-19 data

## FAQ

### What data is available in the Bing COVID-19-Data GitHub repo?
Bing COVID-19 data includes confirmed, fatal, and recovered cases from all regions, updated daily in a .csv file. If there is an update or correction to already-published data, the data file will be updated accordingly. To ensure the stability of the data we share, it will be released with a 24-hour delay.

### What are the sources of the data?
We collect data from multiple trusted, reliable sources, including the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), national and state public health departments, [BNO News](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/), [24/7 Wall St.](https://247wallst.com/), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic).

### How can I use this data?
This information is available strictly for educational and academic purposes, such as medical research, government agencies, and academic institutions. Data used or cited in publications should include an attribution to 'Bing COVID-19 Tracker' with a link to www.bing.com/covid.

### Why is data missing or inconsistent for some regions
Sources don't always provide counts for all data points, especially recovered case counts. The '-' symbol indicates where data is unavailable. In the dataset published in GitHub, the data field will be blank where data is unavailable.

### Where can I see the latest data?
The most current data available can be found on www.bing.com/covid and in the Bing COVID-19 widget. You can find more information about the Bing COVID-19 widget [here](https://www.bing.com/covid/dev#widget).
 
### Why is COVID data different on every website?
COVID tracking data comes from a wide set of sources that update at different times and may not always align.
